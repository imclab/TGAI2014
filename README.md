Zoobot (Or whatever we decide to call it)
======
Team (need to find a teamname)'s bot for The Gathering 2014 AI Programming compo   

Will probably be written in js and run in browser. This makes it able to run extensive and intuitive debugging.

---

We can use EmberJS to connect to a template and update it in real time.   

Debugging:
- Status-display
- Map
 - Path
 - Other Players
 - Powerups
- Actionlog
- Ability to pause bot(?)
